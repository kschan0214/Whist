This matlab pipeline has 2 main purposes 

(1) Create WM models with chosen microstructure parameters using realistic axon shapes. 
The corresponding function are placed in the createWMModel folder.
See createOneWMModelExample.m for an example of usage
See complete_WM_Model_creation.mp4 for a video illustration

(2) Simulate the field perturbation and the corresponding multi GRE signal from a WM model.
The corresponding function are placed in the signalSimulation folder.
See simulateFieldPerturbationExample.m for an example of usage
See simulate_field_perturbation_and_GRE_signal.mp4 for an illustration
